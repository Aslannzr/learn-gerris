## Learning Gerris

Collection of modified input files to [Gerris](http://gfs.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) based on the
examples and the test suite of the code. The new things here should be the dam break problem (described by Navier-
Stokes) and Tormod's test case of tank being filled by water.
