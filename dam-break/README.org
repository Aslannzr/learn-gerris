** TODO 
   Setup of the problem is taken from the paper by Guermond et al

     __An conservative anti-diffusion technique for the level set method__

   section 11.2. Therein, no surface tension is included. I am interested
   in the following matrix of setups where the surface is either includeded
   (1) or excluded (0) and rho, mu are based on filtered (1) or unfilted (0)
   VOF function.

   |      | Tension | Tension |
   |------+---------+---------|
   | \rho | (1, 1)  | (1, 0)  |
   | \rho | (0, 1)  | (0, 0   |

   I will use adaptivity guided by VOF gradient and vorticity criteria, 
   CFL=0.5. For mesh convergence the coarsest and finest level of adaptivity
   will be modified. Keep track of bubbles.
